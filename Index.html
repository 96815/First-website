   <h1> My Favorite Dog Breeds</h1> 
</body><p>One of my favorite dog breeds is a Dachshund. Their affable personality and high energy makes them game for most any adventure. Coming from the hound group, they enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, which lets them indulge their instinctual love for following scents. Truly, with this breed, there's something for every tasteâ€”they come in more colors, sizes, and coat types than any other AKC-recognized breed.</p>

</html><p>Another one of my favorite dog breeds is a Dalmatian. These dogs are very loyal to their humans and can become a good watchdog, ever faithful to the whole family. A dalmatian is a stable breed, meaning they aren't likely to engage in unpredictable behavior. A dalmatian can be a big goof once they are comfortable with their pack, making them a great playmate.</p>

</html><p>Another one of my favorite dog breeds is the Papillon. The quick, curious Papillon is a toy dog of singular beauty and upbeat athleticism. Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a 'doggy dog' blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly.</p>

<html><p>Last but not least is the Borzoi, they are good-natured, gentle and calm, seemingly amused at whatever entertainment comes their way. They are happiest when that entertainment involves running. True to their heritage, borzoi are avid hunters, and will chase any small fleeing animal.</p>
